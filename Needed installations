You will need to install this package.
install.packages("wesanderson")

And then you will need to aplly these to the code before you begin working.
I have left it in as part of the code so you should be able to just copy and paste the code and then run it. 

library(plyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(ggrepel)
library(readr)
library(RCurl)
library(jpeg)
