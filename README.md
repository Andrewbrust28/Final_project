# Final_project
My project is an attempt at pulling data from a couple websites and then turning it into a graph that highlights all of their top statistics over the years the have been playing. 
In my application, im basing it off of the top earning esports pro players on the game Rainbow Six Seige.
This code gives the example with a player named Shaiiko but with the code im building you should be able plug in a players name from the website and it should be able to show you a graph of all the important statistics from their matches which you can then compare to other players to see who has been the most dominant.
