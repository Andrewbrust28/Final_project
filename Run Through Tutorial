Step 1 is to install the packages 
install.packages("wesanderson")
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("ggrepel")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("RCurl")
install.packages("jpeg")


Step 2 is to Load the libraries
library(plyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(ggrepel)
library(readr)
library(RCurl)
library(jpeg)


Step 3 is to get player stats from the website "https://r6.tracker.network"
Add player name and player slug, in this case I chose the player Shaiiko
player <- "Shaiiko"
slug <- "Shaiiko"

Then define player page URL and player image URL
url <- paste0("https://r6.tracker.network/profile/pc/Shaiiko.BDS")
image_url <- paste0("https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/File:Shaiiko.jpg")
